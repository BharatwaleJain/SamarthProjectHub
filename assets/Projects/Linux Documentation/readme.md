## Introduction

The **Linux Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a powerful tool that gives users direct control over the operating system. Mastering the CLI enables users to automate tasks, troubleshoot efficiently, and perform complex actions with simple commands.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Opening the Terminal**:
   - Use `Ctrl + Alt + T` on most Linux distributions.
   - Alternatively, press `Ctrl + Alt + F1` to open a TTY session (press `Ctrl + Alt + F7` to return to GUI).

2. **Essential Commands**:
   - **`man`** - Shows the manual for any command.
     ```bash
     man ls  # Opens the manual for 'ls'
     ```

3. **Autocompletion and History**:
   - Use `Tab` to autocomplete commands and filenames.
   - Press the `↑` and `↓` arrows to browse through command history.

## Basic Commands

### Navigating Directories

1. **`pwd`** - Prints the current working directory.
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

2. **`ls`** - Lists files and directories.
   ```bash
   ls          # Basic listing
   ls -l       # Detailed listing with permissions and file sizes
   ls -lh      # Human-readable file sizes
   ls -a       # Show hidden files (files that start with '.')
   ```

3. **`cd`** - Changes the directory.
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/directory  # Go to specific directory
   cd ..                  # Move up one level
   cd ~                   # Move to home directory
   cd -                   # Go back to the last directory
   ```

   **Tip**: Use `cd ~` for a quick return to the home directory, or `cd -` to switch back to the last location you were in.

---

### File Operations

1. **`touch`** - Creates a new empty file.
   ```bash
   touch filename.txt
   ```

2. **`cp`** - Copies files or directories.
   ```bash
   cp file1.txt /destination/directory
   cp -r /source/directory /destination/directory  # Copy directories recursively
   ```

3. **`mv`** - Moves or renames files or directories.
   ```bash
   mv oldname.txt newname.txt       # Rename file
   mv file.txt /destination/directory
   ```

4. **`rm`** - Deletes files or directories.
   ```bash
   rm filename.txt                 # Delete file
   rm -r /path/to/directory        # Delete directory recursively
   rm -i filename.txt              # Interactive mode, confirms before deleting
   ```

5. **File Viewing Commands**:
   - **`cat`** - Displays file contents.
     ```bash
     cat filename.txt
     ```

   - **`less`** - Views file with scrollable interface.
     ```bash
     less filename.txt
     ```

   - **`head`** and **`tail`** - Shows the start or end of a file.
     ```bash
     head -n 10 filename.txt   # View first 10 lines
     tail -n 10 filename.txt   # View last 10 lines
     tail -f log.txt           # Follow live updates (useful for monitoring logs)
     ```

---

## System Information and Monitoring

1. **`uname`** - Displays system information.
   ```bash
   uname -a    # Print all system information
   ```

2. **`df`** - Disk usage of filesystems.
   ```bash
   df -h       # Human-readable format
   ```

3. **`du`** - Disk usage of files and directories.
   ```bash
   du -sh /path/to/directory
   ```

4. **System Monitoring**:
   - **`top`** - Displays real-time system processes and resource usage.
   - **`htop`** - Enhanced version of `top` (requires installation).
   - **`free -h`** - Shows memory usage in human-readable format.

---

## Process Management

1. **`ps`** - Lists running processes.
   ```bash
   ps aux     # List all processes with details
   ```

2. **`kill`** - Terminates a process by ID.
   ```bash
   kill PID   # Replace PID with the actual Process ID
   ```

3. **`pkill`** - Terminates processes by name.
   ```bash
   pkill process_name
   ```

4. **Job Control**:
   - **`bg`** - Backgrounds a job.
   - **`fg`** - Brings a job to the foreground.

---

## Permissions Management

1. **`chmod`** - Changes file permissions.
   ```bash
   chmod +x filename.sh     # Adds execute permission
   chmod 755 filename.txt   # Set specific permissions
   ```

2. **`chown`** - Changes file owner and group.
   ```bash
   chown user:group filename.txt
   ```

**Tip**: Use `chmod -R` to change permissions recursively on all files within a directory.

---

## Networking Essentials

1. **`ping`** - Checks connectivity to another network host.
   ```bash
   ping google.com
   ```

2. **`ifconfig`** - Displays network interfaces and their details (try `ip a` for newer distros).

3. **`netstat`** - Shows network connections, routing tables, etc.

4. **`curl`** - Transfers data to or from a server.
   ```bash
   curl http://example.com
   ```

---

## Shell Scripting Basics

A shell script automates tasks. Here’s a quick example:

1. Create a file called `greet.sh`:
   ```bash
   nano greet.sh
   ```

2. Add the following code:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, $USER! Today is $(date)."
   ```

3. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x greet.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./greet.sh
   ```

**Tip**: Use `$(command)` syntax to run commands within a script.

---

## Pro Tips and Tricks

1. **Alias Common Commands**:
   - Save time by creating command aliases.
   ```bash
   alias ll='ls -la'     # Long listing with hidden files
   alias gs='git status' # Git status shortcut
   ```

2. **Quick Directory Navigation**:
   - Use `pushd` and `popd` to manage directory stacks, allowing you to quickly return to previous directories.

3. **Using `find` to Locate Files**:
   ```bash
   find /path -name "*.txt"     # Find all .txt files
   ```

4. **Piping and Redirection**:
   - Use `|` to pipe output from one command to another.
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep 'python'       # Filter processes for 'python'
   ```

5. **Command Substitution for Efficiency**:
   - Embed one command's output within another using `$()`.
   ```bash
   echo "There are $(ls | wc -l) files in this directory."
   ```

6. **Checking Command History**:
   ```bash
   history | grep 'command'     # Search command history
   ```

7. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - **`Ctrl + C`** - Cancel current command.
   - **`Ctrl + Z`** - Suspend current job.
   - **`Ctrl + R`** - Search command history.
